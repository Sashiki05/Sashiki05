## About Me

Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Saverio Cutolo aka <b>Sashiki05</b> I'm currently on a journey to pursue my passion for tech as a web developer, and I'm excited to share my progress with you.

I am transitioning into a career as a web developer after working as a manager in fast food. I want to turn my passion into my profession.

As part of my training at the Wild Code School, I've already completed some exciting projects that I'm proud to share with you :
  - First project was a fictive CV for Mario. It was a fun challenge to bring a beloved video game character to life in a professional setting.

  - Second project was a NASA app that involved fetching APIs. we worked for the first time with scrum methods and sprints for each features. It was a great opportunity to combine my passion for the "space world" with my newfound love for tech. "I am very happy that this app can be a point of reference for all the space fans (specifically NASA fans) like me."

Currently, I'm still in the process of completing my Fullstack web developer training, with a focus on Javascript, React, NodeJS, mySQL, and Express. I'm eager to apply my experience and knowledge to my future career in tech.
